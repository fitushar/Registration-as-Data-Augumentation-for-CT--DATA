# Registration-as-Data-Augumentation-for-CT--DATA

# Main idea: 
Main idea of this project was making some new data using
simple registration technique from existing CT data. This code be a possible
alternative of arbitrary augmentation such as flip, rotation, zoom etc.
# Method used:
A simple but powerful non-rigid registration technique
BSpline is been used for this. There are number of parameters that can be
used to make the variation of the registration to make new data which is
completely different from Moving and Fixed CT used for registration.
